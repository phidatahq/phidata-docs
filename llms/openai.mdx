The GPT models are the best in class LLMs and used as the default LLM by **Assistants**.

## Authentication

Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one [from OpenAI here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `OpenAIChat` with your `Assistant` or `LLMTask`:

<CodeGroup>

```python assistant.py
from phi.assistant import Assistant
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat

assistant = Assistant(
    llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-4-turbo", max_tokens=500, temperature=0.3),
    description="You provide 15 minute healthy recipes.",
)
assistant.print_response("Share a breakfast recipe.", markdown=True)
```

```python tasks.py
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat
from phi.task.llm import LLMTask
from phi.assistant import Assistant
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class StoryTheme(BaseModel):
    setting: str = Field(..., description="This is the context of the story. If not available, provide a random setting.")
    genre: str = Field(..., description="This is the genre of the story. If not provided, select horror.")


get_story_theme = LLMTask(
    llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
    system_prompt="Generate a theme for a story.",
    output_model=StoryTheme,
    show_output=False,
)

write_story = LLMTask(
    llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    system_prompt="Write a 2 sentence story for a given theme. It should be less than 30 words.",
)

give_story_a_name = LLMTask(
    llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    system_prompt="Give this story a 2 word name. Format output as `Name: {name}`. Don't surround with quotes.",
)

story_generator = Assistant(tasks=[get_story_theme, write_story, give_story_a_name])
story_generator.print_response("New York 1 million years from now", markdown=True)
```

## Params

For more information, please refer to the [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) as well.

<ResponseField name="model" type="str" default="gpt-4-turbo">
  OpenAI model ID.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="seed" type="int">
  If specified, openai system will make a best effort to sample
  deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and
  parameters should return the same result.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_tokens" type="int">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="temperature" type="float">
  What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
  make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
  focused and deterministic.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="frequency_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood
  to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="response_format" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  An object specifying the format that the model must output.
  Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="frequency_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="presence_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
  talk about new topics.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="stop" type="List[str]">
  Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="user" type="str">
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_p" type="float">
  An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where
  the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="logit_bias" type="Any">
  Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts
  a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer)
  to an associated bias value from -100 to 100.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  Headers added to the OpenAI request.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="api_key" type="str">
  OpenAI API Key
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="organization" type="str">
  OpenAI organization
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="base_url" type="str">
  OpenAI Base URL
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="client_params" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  Additional key word argumens used when creating the `OpenAI()` client.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="openai_client" type="OpenAI">
  Provide your own OpenAI() client to use
</ResponseField>

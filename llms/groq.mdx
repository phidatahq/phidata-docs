Groq offers blazing-fast API endpoints for large language models

## Authentication

Set your `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export GROQ_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx GROQ_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Groq` with your `Assistant`:

<CodeGroup>

```python assistant.py
from phi.assistant import Assistant
from phi.llm.groq import Groq

assistant = Assistant(
    llm=Groq(model="mixtral-8x7b-32768"),
    description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.",
    # debug_mode=True,
)
assistant.print_response("Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.", markdown=True)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<ResponseField name="name" type="str" default="Groq">
  The name identifier for the assistant.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="model" type="str" default="mixtral-8x7b-32768">
  The specific model ID used for generating responses.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="frequency_penalty" type="float">
  A number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="logit_bias" type="Any">
  A JSON object that modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion by mapping token IDs to bias values between -100 and 100.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="logprobs" type="int">
  The number of log probabilities to return for each generated token.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_tokens" type="int">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="presence_penalty" type="float">
  A number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="response_format" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  Specifies the format that the model must output. Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, ensuring the message generated is valid JSON.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="seed" type="int">
  A seed value for deterministic sampling, ensuring repeated requests with the same seed and parameters return the same result.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="stop" type="Union[str, List[str]]">
  Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="temperature" type="float">
  The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and deterministic.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_logprobs" type="int">
  The number of top log probabilities to return for each generated token.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_p" type="float">
  Nucleus sampling parameter. The model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="user" type="str">
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, helping to monitor and detect abuse.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="extra_headers" type="Any">
  Additional headers to include in the API request.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="extra_query" type="Any">
  Additional query parameters to include in the API request.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="api_key" type="str">
  The API key for authenticating requests to the service.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="organization" type="str">
  The organization associated with the API key.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="base_url" type="str">
  The base URL for making API requests to the service.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="timeout" type="float">
  The timeout duration for requests, specified in seconds.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_retries" type="int">
  The maximum number of retry attempts for failed requests.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="default_headers" type="Any">
  Default headers to include in all API requests.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="default_query" type="Any">
  Default query parameters to include in all API requests.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="groq_client" type="GroqClient">
  An instance of GroqClient provided for making API requests.
</ResponseField>

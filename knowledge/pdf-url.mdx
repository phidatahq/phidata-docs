title: PDF URL Knowledge Base
sidebarTitle: PDF URLs

The **PDFUrlKnowledgeBase** reads **PDFs from urls**, converts them into vector embeddings and loads them to a vector database.

## Usage

<Note>

We are using a local PgVector database for this example. [Make sure it's running](https://docs.phidata.com/vectordb/pgvector)

</Note>

```shell
pip install pypdf
```

```python knowledge_base.py
from phi.knowledge.pdf import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from phi.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector

knowledge_base = PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
    urls=["pdf_url"],
    # Table name: ai.pdf_documents
    vector_db=PgVector(
        table_name="pdf_documents",
        db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai",
    ),
)
```

Then use the `knowledge_base` with an Agent:

```python agent.py
from phi.agent import Agent
from knowledge_base import knowledge_base

agent = Agent(
    knowledge=knowledge_base,
    search_knowledge=True,
)
agent.knowledge.load(recreate=False)

agent.print_response("Ask me about something from the knowledge base")
```

## Params

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `urls` | `List[str]` | - | URLs for `PDF` files. |
| `reader` | `PDFUrlReader` | - | A `PDFUrlReader` that converts the `PDFs` into `Documents` for the vector database. |

`PDFUrlKnowledgeBase` is a subclass of the [AgentKnowledge](/reference/knowledge_base) class and has access to the same params.

## Serve your Agents using FastApi

Streamlit is great for building micro front-ends but any production application will be built using a front-end framework like [next.js](https://nextjs.org) backed by a RestApi built using [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Your Agent App comes ready-to-use with FastApi endpoints. Start the `api` using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi ws up --group api
```

```bash shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker:api
```

</CodeGroup>

- Open [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to view the API Endpoints.
- Test the `/v1/playground/agent/run` endpoint with

```json
{
  "message": "howdy",
  "agent_id": "example-agent",
  "stream": true
}
```

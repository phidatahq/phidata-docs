## AWS Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Credentials">
    To run on AWS, you need **one** of the following:

    1. The `~/.aws/credentials` file with your AWS credentials
    2. **or** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables

    <Note>

    To create the credentials file, install the [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and run `aws configure`

    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Update region and subnets">
    Add 2 [subnets](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#subnets:) to the `workspace/settings.py` file (required for ECS services)

    ```python workspace/settings.py
    ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
        ...
        # -*- AWS settings
        # Add your Subnet IDs here
        subnet_ids=["subnet-xyz", "subnet-xyz"],
        ...
    )
    ```

    <Note>

    Please check that the subnets belong to the selected `aws_region`

    </Note>

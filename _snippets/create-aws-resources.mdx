## Create AWS resources

Create AWS resources using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi ws up --env prd --infra aws
```

```bash shorthand
phi ws up prd:aws
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create:

1. [ECS Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html) for the application.
2. [ECS Task Definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) and [Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) that run the application on the ECS cluster.
3. [LoadBalancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) to route traffic to the application.
4. [Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html) that control incoming and outgoing traffic.
5. [Secrets](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) for managing application and database secrets.
6. [RDS Database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for Knowledge Base and Storage.

**Press Enter** to confirm and grab a cup of coffee while the resources spin up.

- The RDS database takes about 5 minutes to activate.
- These resources are defined in the `workspace/prd_resources.py` file.
- Use the [ECS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2/clusters) to view services and logs.
- Use the [RDS console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?#databases:) to view the database instance.

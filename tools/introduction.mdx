Tools are **functions** that an Assistant can run to achieve tasks like searching the web, running SQL, sending an email and calling APIs. **Tools make LLMs autonomous**.

You can use any python function as a tool or use a pre-built **Toolkit**. The general syntax is:

```python
from phi.assistant import Assistant

assistant = Assistant(
    # Add functions or Toolkits
    tools=[...],
    # Show tool calls in LLM response.
    show_tool_calls=True
)
```

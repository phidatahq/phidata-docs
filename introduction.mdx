## Why use phidata

**Problem:** LLMs have limited context and cannot take actions.<br />
**Solution:** Add memory, knowledge and tools.
- **Memory:** Enables LLMs to have long-term conversations by storing **chat history** in a database.
- **Knowledge:** Provides LLMs with **business context** by storing information in a vector database.
- **Tools:** Enable LLMs to **take actions** like pulling data from an API, sending emails or querying a database.

Memory & knowledge make LLMs **smarter** while tools make them **autonomous**, together they enable us to build AI Assistants that can achieve any task.

## How it works

- **Step 1:** Create an `Assistant`
- **Step 2:** Add Tools (functions), Knowledge (vectordb) and Storage (database)
- **Step 3:** Serve using Streamlit, FastApi or Django to build your AI application

## Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    Open the `Terminal` and create a python virtual environment.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/aienv
    source ~/.venvs/aienv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install phidata">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U phidata
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U phidata
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Assistant">

    Create a file `assistant.py` with an Assistant that can search the web using DuckDuckGo.

    ```python assistant.py
    from phi.assistant import Assistant
    from phi.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo

    assistant = Assistant(tools=[DuckDuckGo()], show_tool_calls=True)
    assistant.print_response("Whats happening in France?", markdown=True)
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Assistant">

    Assistants use `OpenAI` by default. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` (you can get one from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Install `openai` & `duckduckgo`

    ```shell
    pip install openai duckduckgo-search
    ```

    Run the Assistant

    ```shell
    python assistant.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Looking to build an AI product?

We've helped many companies build AI products, the general workflow is:

1. **Build an Assistant** with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. **Connect your product** to the Assistant via an API.
3. **Monitor and Improve** your AI product.

We also provide dedicated support and development, [book a call](https://cal.com/phidata/intro) to get started.

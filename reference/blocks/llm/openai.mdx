## OpenAI Reference

<ResponseField name="model" type="str">
  OpenAI model ID.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_tokens" type="int">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="temperature" type="float">
  What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
  make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
  focused and deterministic.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="frequency_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood
  to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="presence_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
  talk about new topics.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_p" type="float">
  An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where
  the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="stop" type="List[str]">
  Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="user" type="str">
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  Headers added to the OpenAI request.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="logit_bias" type="Any">
  Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts
  a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer)
  to an associated bias value from -100 to 100.
</ResponseField>

## LLM Reference

`OpenAIChat` is a subclass of the `LLM` class and has access to the same params
